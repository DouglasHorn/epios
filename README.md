# Epios
Anonymous epidemic testing framework, mobile app, and supporting infrastructure

## True anonymity, real practicality

Epios exists to provide true anonymity to individuals seeking testing for epidemic diseases, beginning with COVID-19. Without risking this anonymity, Epios will also seek to provide practical advantages beyond informing the individual, namely aggregate information on all anonymous testing by country to better inform epidemiologists about otherwise hidden population results and providing certificates of lab testing to organizations that will accept these, such as airline or rail travel.

More information about the Epios project and whitepaper are accessible at epios.org
